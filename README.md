## 🚀 Project Overview
**Predelix** is an intelligent, end-to-end AI solution designed to transform modern retail supply chains. It addresses two key operational pain points:
1. **Inventory Demand Forecasting** – helping vendors prevent stockouts and overstocking.
2. **Last-Mile Delivery Coordination** – automating customer communication via AI-powered voice bots.

Built for scale and real-world usability, Predelix leverages machine learning, voice automation, and real-time analytics to help businesses operate smarter and faster.

## 🏆 Problem Statement

> **Transforming retail supply chains: From inventory management to last-mile delivery**
>
> The complexity of modern retail demands intelligent automation—from predicting product demand to coordinating timely deliveries. Shortages, overstocking, delivery failures, and missed customer communication lead to financial losses and poor customer experience.
>
> Can AI and predictive analytics create a seamless, efficient, and customer-friendly supply chain?

## 💡 What Does Predelix Do?

### 📊 **1. Intelligent Stock Optimization**
- Accepts CSV sales data from retail stores.
- Predicts store-level demand by date and SKU using AI.
- Helps prevent both overstocking and product shortages.
- Ensures vendors always stock the right quantity, at the right time, in the right store.

### 📞 **2. Automated Delivery Coordination**
- Accepts CSV input of customers from delivery partners.
- Bot automatically calls each customer to:
  - Confirm delivery availability time.
  - Ask for specific delivery instructions.
- Transcribes user responses and displays them in the dashboard.
- Missed/disconnected calls are queued.
- Delivery agents can trigger **“Retry Calls”** for failed numbers using a button.

2. AI model analyzes past trends.
3. Platform predicts product quantities needed by store & date.
4. Results shown on dashboard and available via API.

### 📞 Delivery Workflow:
1. Delivery partner uploads customer CSV.
2. Voice bot calls each customer, collects responses.
3. Bot transcribes and stores delivery preferences.
